# NLP Tasks Documentation Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and documenting Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using the Hugging Face library. The main goal is to explore various NLP techniques, algorithms, and models provided by Hugging Face and create a comprehensive guide for understanding and implementing these tasks.

## Purpose

- Learn various NLP tasks and techniques.
- Document steps and code for processing data, tokenization, and using pre-trained models.
- Explore Hugging Face's capabilities and contribute to the community's understanding of NLP.

## Contents

- `Processing_data.py`: This script contains functions for processing data related to NLP tasks.
- `Tokenization.py`: This file includes code for tokenizing text data, an essential step in many NLP tasks.
- `pipeline.py`: The pipeline module provides a streamlined approach to executing NLP tasks using pre-trained models and processing steps.
- `pipleline_Application.png`: A visual representation of the pipeline application for NLP tasks.
- `transformers_applications.png`: Another visual aid showcasing the applications of transformer-based models in NLP.
- `MBTI Classifier.ipynb`: Notebook containing code for MBTI classification task using the Hugging Face library.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository to gain insights into NLP tasks and how they can be implemented using Hugging Face's tools and libraries.
